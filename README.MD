## **Description**
### **Why Should I Learn Machine Learning & Deep Learning?**

If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Machine learning and Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Machine learning and Deep Learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago.

This is a Four Week Course (not including the first free week).

### **Date And Time**

### **Week 3 :  Basic Deep Learning**

Neural Networks has shown its power in Image Recognition, Character Recognition, Forecasting and many other areas where predictions can be made with a much higher accuracy than others. So the next four sessions aim at delving you deeper into the world of Deep Learning. You will know about Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and have hands-on experience in building an ANN and CNN.

- Session 1: Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Session 2: Building of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Session 3: Introduction to Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)
- Session 4: Building of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN)

### **Week 4 : Advanced Deep Learning**
After learning ANN and CNNs it is time to move on to advanced Neural Networks concepts. We go into Recurrent Neural Networks.

- Session 1: Introduction to Recurrent neural network and LSTM
- Session 2: Project in LSTM
- Session 3: Autoencoders - Unsupervised Deep Learning
- Session 4: GANs - Generate images
